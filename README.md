This is an open source Java library for the [mega.nz][mega] API, working on top of the [MEGAcmd][megacmd] CLI. 
There is a [Quick Start][quick-start] available for developers who want to start using the library right away.

## Additional Features
This features have no corresponding Megacmd command, but they are infered from the existing ones

### Count
Show the amount of elements in a folder or that match the query mask. E.g.

```java
    final long amountOfFilesAndDirectories = sessionMega.count("remote/path");
```

But what if you want to filter that counting and it a Predicate to, for instance,
just get the files and not the directories.

```java
    final long amountOfFiles = sessionMega.count("remote/path", FileInfo::isFile);
```

### Exists
This is pretty much the equivalent of `java.io.File.exists`. It checks if the remote path or mask
indicates any non null response. E.g.
 
```java
    sessionMega.exists("remote/path/filesprefix*.ext");
```

### Export with an expiration date
With a premium mega account, you can export and generate public folder links by setting the option `expire date`.
```java
    LocalDate expireDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 9, 2);
    final ExportInfo exportInfo = sessionMega.export(exportFolder)
            .setExpireDate(expireDate)
            .call();
```

or you can just specify a duration using `TimeDelay`.

```java  
    final ExportInfo exportInfo = sessionMega.export(exportFolder)
        .setExpirationTimeDelay(TimeDelay.of(
             Period.ofYears(3).plusMonths(11).plusDays(15)
         ))
        .call();
```

### MEGAcmdServer
Thanks to the class `io.github.eliux.mega.MegaServer` you can now `start` and `stop` the local MEGAcmdServer on command.

## System requirements
* Install [MEGAcmd][megacmd]. Available packages for MEGAcmd in all supported 
platforms should be found [here][megacmd-install].

### Environment variables to set

* `MEGA_EMAIL`: Email used as username (lowercase)
* `MEGA_PWD`: Corresponding password
* `CMD_TTL_ENV_VAR`: Maximum time to live of a running MEGAcmd command. By default, 20 seconds.

### Setup your credentials
1. The most common way to setup your credentials would be using the environment variables `MEGA_EMAIL` 
and `MEGA_PWD`.

2. To use an existing session can be a safer way. You can use it from your app as long as it don't be closed.

```bash
    gem install travis
```
